# Vrinda Store 

## Overview

#### This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset "Vrinda Store Data Cleaning.xlsx" to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for further analysis. The dataset likely contains raw data that requires handling of missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and other quality issues.

## Data Cleaning Process

The following steps were performed to clean the dataset:

1. Handling Missing Values

   Checked for null values and filled/replaced them appropriately.

   Ensured critical fields like Order ID, Amount, and Date had no missing values.


2. Removing Duplicates

   Identified and removed duplicate Order ID entries.


3. Standardizing Data Types

   Converted Date to proper datetime format.

   Ensured numerical values (Age, Amount, ship-postal-code) had correct data types.


4. Fixing Inconsistencies

   Standardized Gender values (e.g., "Women" vs. "Female").

   Unified product Category names for consistency.

   Checked Channel names for spelling variations.

   Ensured currency format was uniform (INR).
